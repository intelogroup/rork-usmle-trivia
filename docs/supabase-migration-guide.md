## Database Schema

The app now uses these Supabase tables:
- `categories` - Quiz categories
- `questions` - Quiz questions with options and explanations
- `quiz_sessions` - User quiz attempts and scores
- `quiz_attempts` - Individual question attempts

All tables have proper RLS policies to ensure users can only access their own data.

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your Supabase project:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anon key

The app is now fully integrated with Supabase and ready for production use!
