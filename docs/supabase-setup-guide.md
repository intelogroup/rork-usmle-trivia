   - Click **"New query"** button
   - This will open a blank SQL editor

2. **Copy the Complete Setup Script**
   - Copy ALL the content from the script below
   - Make sure you get everything from the first line to the last line

3. **Paste and Execute**
   - Paste the entire script into the SQL editor
   - Click **"Run"** (or press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter)
   - Wait for execution to complete (should take 10-15 seconds)

## Step 4: Verify Success

After running the script, you should see at the bottom:
- âœ… "Setup completed successfully!"
- âœ… "Categories created: 6"
- âœ… "Questions created: 10"

## Step 5: Test in Your App

1. Go back to your app
2. Click **"Test Supabase Connection"** again
3. You should now see:
   - âœ… Supabase connection successful
   - âœ… Database schema verified
   - âœ… Sample data found
   - ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed!

## What This Creates

### Tables:
- **categories** - Quiz categories (6 sample categories)
- **questions** - Quiz questions with multiple choice (10 sample questions)
- **quiz_sessions** - User quiz attempts and scores
- **quiz_attempts** - Individual question attempts for analytics

### Security:
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Users can only access their own quiz data
- Public read access for categories and questions

### Sample Data:
- 6 categories: General Knowledge, Science, Technology, Geography, Mathematics, History
- 10 sample questions across different categories and difficulties
- Proper relationships and indexes for performance

## Troubleshooting

If you get any errors:
1. Make sure you copied the ENTIRE script
2. Check that you're the owner of the Supabase project
3. Try refreshing the SQL Editor and running again
4. Check the Supabase logs for detailed error messages

Once this is complete, your quiz app will be fully functional with Supabase! ðŸŽ‰
